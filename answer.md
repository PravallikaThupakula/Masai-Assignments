Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

The Frontend (FE) is the part of a web application that users directly see and interact with. It runs in the user’s browser and focuses on appearance, usability, and user experience.

User Interface:

=>Frontend is responsible for designing the layout of the website.
=>It includes buttons, forms, text, images, menus, and pages.
=>Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to build the UI.

User Interaction:

=>Handles user actions such as clicks, typing, scrolling, and form submissions.
=>Provides instant feedback like validation messages or animations.
=>Improves usability and responsiveness of the application.

Communication with Backend:

=>Frontend sends requests to the backend using APIs (HTTP/HTTPS).
=>It receives data (usually in JSON format) and displays it to users.

Example: Fetching user details or submitting login information.


Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

The Backend (BE) is the server-side part of a web application that works behind the scenes. It handles logic, data processing, and security.

Server-Side Processing:

=>Backend processes requests received from the frontend.
=>It performs calculations, validations, and business rules.
=>Generates responses based on application logic.

Database Handling:

=>Backend communicates with databases to store and retrieve data.
=>Handles operations like insert, update, delete, and fetch.
=>Ensures data consistency and integrity.

Security and Authentication:

=>Manages user authentication and authorization.
=>Protects sensitive data using encryption and secure protocols.
=>Prevents unauthorized access and cyber attacks.


Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic refers to the rules and conditions that control how an application works according to business requirements.
It decides what should happen, when, and under what conditions.

Why Business Logic is Important?

=>Ensures correct functionality of the application
=>Enforces business rules
=>Maintains data accuracy and consistency

Real-World Examples:

1.E-commerce Website
Apply discounts only if the cart value exceeds ₹1000.
Prevent purchase if the product is out of stock.

2.Banking Application
Allow money transfer only if the balance is sufficient.
Set daily withdrawal limits.

3.Online Exam System
Auto-submit exam when time expires.
Prevent multiple attempts if only one attempt is allowed.


Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a communication architecture where tasks are divided between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients).

Client:

=>The client is the user’s device (browser or app).
=>Sends requests to the server.
=>Displays responses received from the server.

Server:

=>The server processes client requests.
=>Executes business logic and accesses the database.
=>Sends responses back to the client.

Communication Process:

1.Client sends a request (HTTP request).
2.Server processes the request.
3.Server sends a response (data or result).
4.Client displays the response.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

3-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three independent layers for better scalability and maintenance.

Presentation Layer:

=>This is the frontend layer.
=>Responsible for UI and user interaction.
=>Runs in the browser.

Application (Business) Layer:

=>Contains business logic and processing.
=>Acts as a bridge between frontend and database.
=>Handles validations and rules.

Data Layer:

=>Manages data storage.
=>Includes databases and data access logic.
=>Ensures secure and efficient data management.

Why 3-Tier Architecture is Used?

Improves scalability
Enhances security
Easier maintenance and updates
Better separation of concerns

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used as a backend language because of its efficiency and strong ecosystem.

Performance:

=>Uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
=>Handles multiple requests efficiently.
=>Suitable for real-time applications.

Ecosystem:

=>Large collection of libraries and packages (NPM).
=>Strong community support.
=>Easy integration with frontend JavaScript.

Popular Backend Frameworks:
Node.js
Express.js
NestJS
Fastify

JavaScript allows developers to use the same language for both frontend and backend, making development faster and more efficient.
